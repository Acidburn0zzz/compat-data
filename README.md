# Firefox Site Compatibility Data

Our goal is creating an accurate, up-to-date data source of the site compatibility status in Firefox, including channel specifics, deprecations and other details, maintained along with our [documentation](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/docs/). While this dataset already powers our own [Firefox DevTools extension](https://github.com/fxsitecompat/firefox-extension)’s compatibility checker, it’s still under development and therefore not yet available for general use.
